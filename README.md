NetSentinel AI 🛡️

NetSentinel AI is a comprehensive network vulnerability scanner and visualization tool. It combines the raw scanning power of Nmap (via Python) with a modern web interface to identify open ports, detect services, classify security risks, and provide AI-driven remediation strategies.

🚀 Key Features

Deep Scanning: Performs TCP Connect scans (-sT) to identify open ports and services using python-nmap.

Vulnerability Assessment: Automatically categorizes findings into High, Medium, and Low risk levels.

AI Remediation Assistant: Select a vulnerable device/port to receive step-by-step fixing instructions generated by AI.

Network Visualization: Interactive network map visualizing the topology of connected devices.

Subnet Support: Capable of scanning entire subnets (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24) in addition to single IP addresses.

Report Generation: One-click PDF export of scanning results for documentation and compliance.

Hybrid Architecture: robust Python scanning engine coupled with a responsive Node.js/Express backend.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Backend

Python: Core logic for network interaction.

python-nmap: Wrapper for the Nmap tool.

socket: For low-level network interface operations.

json: Data parsing and formatting.

Node.js: Server-side orchestration.

Express: REST API framework.

Cors: Middleware for cross-origin resource sharing.

Child Process: Spawns Python scripts for scanning tasks.

Frontend

HTML5 & CSS3: Responsive layout and styling.

JavaScript (ES6+): Client-side logic and DOM manipulation.

Visualization Libs: (Recommended: D3.js or Cytoscape.js for the network map).

PDF Generation: (Recommended: jsPDF or html2pdf).

⚙️ Workflow Architecture

User Input: The user provides a target IP address or Subnet CIDR via the web interface.

Request Handling: The frontend sends the target to the Node.js/Express server.

Process Spawning: The Express server spawns a child process to execute the specific Python scanning script.

Scanning (Python):

The Python script initializes nmap.

It performs a -sT (TCP Connect) scan.

It analyzes the return data for open ports and banners.

Risk Analysis: The Python logic assigns risk levels (High/Med/Low) based on the services found.

Response: Results are serialized to JSON and sent back to the Node.js server, then to the frontend.

Visualization: The frontend parses the JSON to populate the results table and draw the network map.

AI Remediation: If the user queries a specific vulnerability, the system sends the context to the AI module to generate a fix guide.

📦 Installation & Setup

Prerequisites

Nmap: Must be installed on the host machine.

Linux: sudo apt-get install nmap

Windows: Download the installer from nmap.org.

Python 3.x

Node.js & npm

1. Clone the Repository

git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/netsentinel-ai.git](https://github.com/yourusername/netsentinel-ai.git)
cd netsentinel-ai


2. Backend Setup (Node.js)

Navigate to the server directory and install dependencies.

cd backend
npm install
# Ensure express and cors are installed
npm install express cors


3. Scanner Setup (Python)

Install the required Python libraries.

pip install python-nmap requests


4. Configuration

Create a .env file in the root if you are using an external API key for the AI feature.

AI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
PORT=3000


▶️ Usage

Start the Backend Server:

node server.js


Server should run on http://localhost:3000

Launch the Frontend:
Open index.html in your browser (or serve it via Live Server).

Run a Scan:

Enter an IP (e.g., 192.168.1.15) or Subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).

Click Scan.

Wait for the progress bar to complete.

View Results:

Check the "Vulnerabilities" table for Red (High), Orange (Medium), and Yellow (Low) indicators.

Click the "Network Map" tab to see the topology.

Click the "Fix with AI" button next to a vulnerability to see solution steps.

Click "Export PDF" to save the report.
